🔍 Assesses chronic risk levels via ML + rules  
📋 Delivers personalized health plans (diet, sleep, exercise)  
🧠 Motivates with chat nudges & feedback  
🔐 Secures all data via **blockchain + encryption**

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Frontend**: React.js, HTML/CSS, JS  
**Backend**: Python (Flask), Java  
**Database**: MongoDB  
**APIs**: Twitter API, NewsAPI  
**AI/ML**: Microsoft AutoGen, GPT APIs, XGBoost  
**Security**: Blockchain, Cryptography  
**Tools**: VS Code, Figma, Android Studio
